## My notes about what I did to get the index page speed to 90 and above:
1. downloaded the portfolio folder from git
2. Analysed it and found that the scripts should be async
3. removed the css include and made inline(inside the html)
4. the images for profile and pizzaria were way too big and minimized those
5. I have a hosting and put all these there and got speed of 94 / 95 (www.fancyafghans.com)
6. So I think for part 1 I should be good now.
7. used some code from http://davidwalsh.name/google-fonts-api to use instead of creating the critical resource of webfont

##Part 2:
1. line 533 lowerd the looping number of pizzas to 25 
2. created a variable outside of the loop for scrolTop / 1250 lines 509 and 512
3. took the dx and newwidth outside of the loop in lines 454 and created a count variable for loop counter line 456
4. included the FPS counts image while testin in FPS.png. the meter was not correct but the bars should correctly.
##After evaluation
1. moved var pizzasDiv = document.getElementById("randomPizzas"); out of loop at line 475
2. used window.window.innerHeight to get the window hight and calculate the count of pizzas in line 533
3. changed to getElementsByClassName in line 508
##After 2nd eval:

1. moved item.lenght out of looping line 509
2. changed line the queryBySelector to getElementsByClassName
3.

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
